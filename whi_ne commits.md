## **Summary**

I do not really know how to summarize changes introduced in this commit, so I'll just list the major ones in here:

- Removed application's code in this branch

## **Changes**

The changes said earlier will not be repeated in here, unless some details are spared, of which, they'll be explained deeper in here.

### **Removed**

- Copy constants feature on development utility tool.

## **Plans**

There is no change of plans at the moment.

For now, I will focus on the documentation, issues, and dealing with the users. This includes resolving issues except to that of the application.

Documentation of the development utilities is also on its way.
