## **Summary**

Well, what do we have here? A long awaited fix!

- Fixed wrong links and attribution
- Removed useless markdowns and code
- version file is now synced from the main branch

## **Changes**

Changes cited above will not appear in here, unless they're mentioned in the summary, of which they shall be explained in here.

### ***Removed***

- Removed unnecessary links in `docs/0/0/index.html`
- In README, removed the discord invite.

### ***Fixed***

- `/docs/0/0/index.html` now properly links to the installation page.
- Fixed the Changelog to display `0.0.0-alpha.1` as the intial version, instead of `0.0.0-alpha.0`.
- In README, fixed the status badge and the links.

## **Plans**

I would first like to focus my attention on the following:

- Changing the site's color scheme
- Syncing README from site branch to main branch; and
- Syncing version file from main branch to site branch

Afterwards, I will focus on the documentation, issues, and dealing with the users. This includes resolving issues except to that of the application.

Documentation of the development utilities is also on its way.
