## **Summary**

This commits aims to customize the site's theme.

In any case, this is just a preliminary commit to test out the new theme and iron out the inconsistencies it brought.

## **Plans**

I would first like to focus my attention on the following:

- Tackling [#31](https://github.com/manga-g/manga-g/issues/31) (Site recommendation)
- Syncing README from site branch to main branch; and
- Syncing version file from main branch to site branch

Afterwards, I will focus on the documentation, issues, and dealing with the users. This includes resolving issues except to that of the application.

Documentation of the development utilities is also on its way.
